Stoic wisdom advocates for premeditatio malorum — the continuous visualization of
worst-case scenarios. This negative visualization is said to inoculate one’s wellbeing
against inevitable misfortune and strengthen gratitude for the everyday. The
recommendation rests on the same intuition that derives the famous equality:

$$Happiness = Reality - Expectations$$

to quantify the elusive emotion with the dryness of an accountant. The goal of negative
visualization is not merely to recalibrate one’s internal assessment of what to expect
from the world, but to fundamentally *mis*-calibrate it such that the formula tends
positive. The Stoic strives not to maximize the equation, but to guard against it ever
falling below zero. In modern terms, its tampering with one's own internal "dopamine
reward prediction error" by hacking the prediction.

But what distinguishes Stoic negative visualization from the regular afflictions of the
anxious mind? Anxiety is, after all, precisely the state of continuously suffering from
the visualization of worst-case outcomes.

I will offer two explanations, and refute them both.

## The Magnitude Distinction 
The first distinction is in the magnitudes of how *likely* and how *bad* are the
outcomes that each bears in mind. The stoic visualizes not merely bad outcomes, but
precisely the *worst* possible outcomes (death, ruin) - regardless of thier likelihood.
By contrast the anxious mind suffers concern with even moderately bad outcomes
considered likely enough (by its's own assessemnt, accurate or no) to be worth planning
for.

By this account, the remedy for the anxious mind - knotting itself over thoughts of
impending unpleasantries - is to shout at it: "You're not even imagining things bad
enough! Think of things even worse and less likely!".

## The Category Error
The second difference lies in categorization. While the stoic places their visualization
into the bucket of "expectations" the anxious misidentifies the scenarios as "reality."
The anxious mind says to itself, "My reality is so precarious that these unpleasant
outcomes are effectively happening now." So while the stoic's double-negative becomes a
positive in the happiness equation, the anxious's misplacement calamitously decrements
the total sum.

While both perspecitves hold truth, a philosopher like Nietzsche would ridicule the
attempt to distinguish the anxious and stoic visualizer. Both seek to protect themselves
from the bite of reality. The anxious man trembles before the blow falls; the stoic
hardens his skin so he does not feel it. The stoic is simply the anxious man who has
learned to play a trick on his own nervous system.

The H = R - E equation embodies a poverty of the spirit where your only path to joy is
to bankrupt your hope. "Do not expect too much, and you won't be sad" is herd morality.
The stoic tries to master reality by killing his own vulnerability, the Nietzschean
master accepts his vulnerability because it is the source of his power. The great man
suffers deeply, but he loves his suffering because it is his life.
