I'm a research scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) working
on Gemini.

<!-- Previously I was a researcher at -->
<!-- [EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/) where I worked on -->
<!-- building foundation models for biology. -->

<!-- I have broad research interests in both theoretical and applied machine learning.  -->
My research interests include ultra-long context language models, adaptive
inference compute, and applying large-scale AI systems to scientific domains
such as biology. I believe break-through intelligent systems require excellence
in both research and technical infrastructure.

Previously, as a researcher at
[EvolutionaryScale](https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/) and [Google
X](https://x.company) I worked on building foundation models for biology. I have
a background in Computer Science and Bioengineering from Stanford.

I was a [gymnast](https://jondeaton.github.io/gymnastics/) for 15 years,
competing for Stanford Mens Gymnastics and represented the Unites States on the
Junior National Team in international competitions.

I live in San Mateo, California.
